            <p>
                One activity that I genuinly care about is soccer. 
                This year I am playing for the varsity soccer team and soccer has alwyas been such a big part of my life. I have played soccer since I was little and it has been something that while im not excellent at, <strong>I love it with all my heart</strong> and wouldnt give up my experiences with soccer for anything.

            </p>
            <h2>
                I also play video games
            </h2>
            <p>Some of my favorite games include <strong><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></strong>, <em>Super Smash Brothers Ultimate</em>, and <em>Titanfall 2.</em></p>
